# 🎯 Problem-Solving & Coding Solutions Repository

Welcome to my **Coding Solutions Repository**! This repository is a collection of my solutions to various coding problems and practice exercises, primarily focused on **Java**.

The main goal of this project is to build a well-organized and comprehensive library of solutions to common programming challenges, which can be used for learning, practice, and interview preparation.

## 🚀 Project Structure

The repository is structured to be clean, intuitive, and easy to navigate. The core of the project is the `Java` directory, which is further organized by difficulty level. This structure allows for a clear progression from simpler problems to more complex ones.
